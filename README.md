To use this program to share your files, you have to know the ip address for each of the peers and enter them into the arguments of the other peer.

e.g. peer1: 1.1.1.1 peer2: 2.2.2.2

then for peer1 enter 2.2.2.2 to the argument and vice versa

finally you can just run the code on both machine and share the files with in the predefined directory.
